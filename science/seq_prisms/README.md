This seq_prisms based benchmark generator is quite complicated, and in my view,
should be replaced by a simple set of scripts to run a number of blast/bwa jobs
directly and/or via slurm, without recourse to seq_prisms and/or tardis.

As it stands currently, the fastq files which are referenced here no longer
exist.  I'm afraid I ran out of time to adapt this into something simple and
suitable for the benchmarking activity.
